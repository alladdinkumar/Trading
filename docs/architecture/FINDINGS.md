# Architecture Review — Findings Log

> Running log of **vulnerabilities, gaps, inaccuracies, missing tests/fixtures,
> and tech debt** discovered while writing the [`docs/architecture/`](./PROGRESS.md)
> design set. The layer docs describe *what the code does today*; anything that
> *should change* lands here instead, so it can be triaged and fixed in a
> dedicated pass — after which we revisit and update the docs.

## How to use this file

- Each finding gets a stable ID (`F-NNN`) so docs and commits can reference it.
- Add findings as they're discovered, per phase. Don't fix inline during doc
  writing — capture here, keep moving.
- When fixed: set **Status → Fixed**, note the commit, and update any doc the
  fix invalidates.

### Categories

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VULN` | Security / correctness vulnerability or data-integrity risk |
| `GAP` | Missing functionality, validation, or guardrail |
| `INACC` | Code disagrees with a spec, comment, docstring, or manifest |
| `TEST` | Missing test coverage or a fixture needed to test safely |
| `DEBT` | Cleanup / maintainability / clarity |

### Severity

`High` (can cause wrong trades, data loss, or silent failure) ·
`Med` (degrades robustness or misleads) · `Low` (cosmetic / nice-to-have)

### Status

`Open` · `In progress` · `Fixed` · `Wontfix` (with reason) · `Needs decision`

## Detail

### F-001 — Unused declared dependencies (`INACC`, Med, Phase 0)
`pyproject.toml` declares `vectorbt>=0.26` and `anthropic>=0.40`, but the
backtester is a hand-rolled event loop (Phase 7 deviation) and the LLM runs via
Claude Code skills (Phase 12 deviation, no API credits). A reader could mistake
the manifest for the architecture.
- **Fix idea:** Remove both, or move to an `optional`/commented block with a
  one-line note pointing at the deviation specs. Confirm nothing imports them
  (`grep -r "import vectorbt\|import anthropic"`).
- **Doc to revisit after fix:** `00-overview.md` §3 tech-stack note.

### F-002 — No validation of the broker JSON contract (`GAP`, High, Phase 0)
`/kite-snapshot` and `/kite-quotes-snapshot` write JSON that `data/kite_snapshot.py`
and `data/quotes_snapshot.py` read back into dataclasses. The contract is
enforced only by the skill obeying its `SKILL.md`. A malformed write (wrong
`exchange`, missing required field, wrong types) may pass partially and corrupt
downstream logic (e.g. a wrong-exchange quote driving an MTM exit).
- **Fix idea:** Add a pydantic/dataclass validator at the read boundary that
  fails loudly with a clear remediation message; add `TEST` fixtures of malformed
  payloads.
- **Depends on:** F-006-range fixtures (to be added when Phase 3 is written).

### F-003 — No half-run detection in the daily flow (`GAP`, Med, Phase 0)
The operator runs the blocks manually; skipping IEP (or running blocks out of
order) silently leaves the bundle un-reranked or stale. Nothing reconciles
"which steps ran today".
- **Fix idea:** A lightweight per-date run-state file (or a `run_log` table)
  each step stamps, plus a `trading status --date` that reports gaps.

### F-004 — No canonical clock (`DEBT`, Low, Phase 0)
"Today in IST" is re-derived in several places (`ops/runner._today_ist`, jobs,
skills). Centralising would reduce drift and make freezegun-based tests simpler.

### F-005 — No execution / kill-switch design (`GAP`, High → Needs decision, Phase 0)
The system is paper-only. The Phase 18.5 gate (≥3 months OOS Sharpe > 1.0)
leads to a real-money Phase 19 that currently has no spec, no order-placement
path, and no risk-halt/kill-switch. Logged so the hardening review explicitly
decides scope and sequencing.

### F-006 — Domain types in `data/` couple `store` to ingestion (`DEBT`, Med, Phase 1)
`store/{ohlcv,macro_store,news_store,sector_store}.py` import their row types
from `data/{yfinance,macro,news,sector}.py`. Persistence depends on the fetcher
for "what the row is."
- **Fix idea:** Introduce `trading/domain.py` (or `types/`) holding the frozen
  DTOs; have both `data` and `store` import from there.
- **Doc to revisit:** `01-architecture.md` §3.1 + layer table.

### F-007 — Regime classification lives in the data layer (`DEBT`, Med, Phase 1)
`data.macro.snapshot_and_classify` lazily imports `features.regime` — the only
upward (ingestion→analysis) edge.
- **Fix idea:** Split into a pure `fetch` (in `data`) + `classify` (in
  `features` or the `pre_open` job). Keep `data` fetch-only.
- **Doc to revisit:** `01-architecture.md` §3.2; `03-data-layer.md` (Phase 3).

### F-008 — `strategy ⇄ backtest` cycle (`DEBT`, Med, Phase 1)
Mutual package dependency: `backtest.engine` runs `strategy.*`; `strategy.ranker*`
reuse `backtest.*` for labels/OOS scoring. Only lazy imports prevent an
import-time cycle.
- **Fix idea:** Extract the shared exit-replay/labeling logic into a small
  neutral module both depend on; or formally accept the cycle and document the
  import rules (never import across the seam at module top).
- **Doc to revisit:** `01-architecture.md` §3.3; Phase 4/5 docs.

### F-009 — No layering enforcement (`GAP`, Low, Phase 1)
The downward-dependency rule is convention, unenforced.
- **Fix idea:** Add `import-linter` contracts to CI mirroring the L0–L6 layers.

### F-010 — Dormant tables (`GAP`, Med, Phase 2)
`oi_daily`, `fno_ban_list`, `bulk_block_deals`, `corp_actions`, `account_events`,
`preopen_snapshot`, `live_quotes`, `event_calendar` are defined in schema v1 but
have no writer anywhere in `src/trading`.
- **Fix idea:** Either implement the fetchers/writers, or annotate them as
  reserved in the migration and the schema doc. Decide per-table.
- **Doc to revisit:** `02-data-schema.md` §4.2.

### F-011 — Strategy gates read empty tables (`VULN`, High, Phase 2)
`fno_ban_list` and `event_calendar` are empty (F-010) yet back the Layer-A gates
`passes_not_fno_banned` and `passes_no_critical_event`. If those gates read the
DB (or a context populated from it), an F&O-banned or event-risk stock is **not**
filtered out — a real correctness risk for live selection.
- **Verify in:** Phase 4 — confirm what the gates actually read (DB vs.
  `ScanContext` passed by the job).
- **Fix idea:** Populate the tables (ban list from NSE, events from the news/NSE
  calendar already fetched) and wire them into `ScanContext`; until then, make
  the gate's data-absence explicit (warn, not silently pass).

### F-012 — Universe scope vs. naming (`INACC`, Low→**Med**, Phase 2)
Parquet lives under `data/parquet/nifty200/` but the active set is ~57 symbols
(Nifty 50 + personal holdings).
- **User requirement (2026-06-16):** the **paper-trading candidate universe
  should be the Nifty 50 (50 stocks)** — not the ad-hoc 57, not Nifty 200.
  Holdings may still be scored for portfolio health, but candidate scanning /
  ranking / auto-open should operate over the Nifty 50.
- **Fix idea (fix pass):** Set `data/static/universe.txt` to the 50 Nifty 50
  constituents; align `sector_map.csv`; ensure `ingest-history`, `scan`, the
  ranker, and all daily jobs use that set; rename the `nifty200/` subdir to match
  reality (e.g. `nifty50/` or generic `ohlcv/`).
- **Severity bumped** Low→Med because it now reflects an explicit scope
  requirement, not just a naming nit.

### F-013 — No data retention policy (`GAP`, Low, Phase 2)
`news_items` and `data/raw/<date>/` grow without bound.
- **Fix idea:** Add a prune/compaction command (e.g. keep N days of raw JSON,
  archive/rollup old news).
